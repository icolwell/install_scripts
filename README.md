# Install Scripts

This repo contains a collection of install scripts I have created over the years
to install software that is not easily installed via `apt install`.
The scripts are meant to be used on the latest
[LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS) release of Ubuntu.

# Using the Scripts

There is no need to clone this repo locally, the scripts can be ran as long as
an internet connection exists. Below is an example of running the ROS install
script.

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icolwell/install_scripts/master/ros_install.bash | bash
```
